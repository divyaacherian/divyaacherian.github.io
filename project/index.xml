      <description>Divyaa Cherian dec2769  Introduction The datasets I chose are the 2021 STC Health Index from the Hudsonâ€™s Global Residence Index (https://globalresidenceindex.com/hnwi-index/health-index/), and the 2021 World Happiness Report from World Population Review (https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/happiest-countries-in-the-world). For the health index, I named the dataset world_health, and for the happiness dataset, I named it world_happiness. The world_health dataset contains the following variables: rank, country, health index, healthy life expectancy at birth, maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 live births), proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, under-five mortality rate (per 1000 live births), probability of dying from any of CVD, cancer, diabetes, CRD between age 30 and ext age 70k, mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution (per 100,000 population), mortality rate attributed to exposure to unsafe WASH services (per 100,000 population), mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning (per 100,000 population).</description>
